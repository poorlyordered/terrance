# Project Brief: Terrance - AI Agent Builder

## Core Concept

Terrance is the world's first **"Agenteer"**: an AI agent designed to autonomously build, refine, and optimize other AI agents. It serves as both a practical tool for developers and an educational framework demonstrating the evolution of agentic systems.

## Current Version (as Archon V6)

- **V6 - Tool Library and MCP Integration**: Focuses on integrating a library of prebuilt tools, examples, and MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integrations to enhance agent capabilities and reduce development time. (Note: Functionality based on original Archon V6)

## Vision & Key Principles

1.  **Agentic Reasoning**: Emphasizes planning, iterative feedback, and self-evaluation.
2.  **Domain Knowledge Integration**: Embeds frameworks like Pydantic AI and LangGraph.
3.  **Scalable Architecture**: Modular design for maintainability, cost optimization, and ethical AI.

## High-Level Goal

To provide a platform that allows users (developers) to describe an AI agent they want to build, and have Terrance autonomously generate, refine, and deliver the code for that agent, leveraging best practices and available tools/frameworks.

## Project Evolution (as Archon)

Terrance's codebase originates from Archon, which was developed iteratively:
- V1: Basic RAG agent builder (Pydantic AI)
- V2: Agentic workflow with LangGraph, planning/execution separation
- V3: MCP support for AI IDE integration
- V4: Comprehensive Streamlit UI overhaul, Docker support
- V5: Multi-agent coding workflow with specialized refiner agents
- V6 (Current Base): Tool library, MCP integration, Advisor agent

## Target Audience

- AI Developers
- Researchers studying agentic systems
- Educators teaching AI development
