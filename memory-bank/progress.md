# Progress: Terrance (Based on Archon V6) - Initial Setup & Rename Phase

## What Works

-   **Environment Setup:**
-   Project cloned from original Archon GitHub (`https://github.com/coleam00/Archon`).
-   Python virtual environment (`venv/`) exists.
-   All dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` have been successfully installed into the virtual environment. Pylance import errors are resolved.
-   **Memory Bank:** Initial core documentation files created based on Archon README.

## What's Left to Build / Configure (Based on Archon README Getting Started)

The core application components have not been run or configured yet. The next steps involve using the Streamlit UI (`streamlit run streamlit_ui.py`) to complete the setup (following the original Archon setup process):

1.  **Run Streamlit UI:** Start the application interface.
2.  **Environment Configuration:** Use the UI's "Environment" tab to set up API keys (LLMs, Supabase) and model settings. These will be saved to `workbench/env_vars.json`.
3.  **Database Setup:** Use the UI's "Database" tab to configure the Supabase connection and potentially create the necessary `site_pages` table schema for RAG.
4.  **Documentation Crawling:** Use the UI's "Documentation" tab to crawl and index the required documentation (e.g., Pydantic AI) into the Supabase vector store.
5.  **Agent Service:** Use the UI's "Agent Service" tab to start the backend FastAPI service (`graph_service.py`) that handles agent generation.
6.  **MCP Configuration (Optional):** Use the UI's "MCP" tab if integration with AI IDEs is desired.
7.  **Agent Creation:** Once setup is complete, use the "Chat" tab to interact with Terrance (the agent builder) and begin building agents.

## Current Status

-   Project code (based on Archon V6) is present and dependencies are installed.
-   The application requires initial configuration through its Streamlit UI before it is functional.
-   Memory Bank foundation established and updated with the "Terrance" name.

## Known Issues

-   None identified at this stage, as the application hasn't been run yet. Potential issues might arise during the UI-based setup process.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

-   *N/A at this initial stage.* This section will track significant changes or pivots as development progresses.
